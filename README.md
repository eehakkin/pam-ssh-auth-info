# PAM SSH Authentication Information Module

The pam_ssh_auth_info.so PAM module is designed to succeed or fail
authentication based on SSH authentication information consisting of a
list of successfully completed authentication methods and public
credentials (e.g. keys) used to authenticate the user.
One use is to select whether to load other modules based on this test.

## Requirements

The following packages are required in order to build and install this
module:

* PAM development files (libpam-dev, pam-devel or such)
* Automake (automake)
* Autoconf (autoconf)

The following packages are required in order to make use of this module:

* OpenSSH server (openssh-server >= 7.8p1)

## Building and Installation

The following commands can be used to build this module:

1. autoreconf --install
2. ./configure
3. make
4. sudo make install

It may be necessary to pass
--libdir=DIR,
--exec-prefix=EPREFIX or
--prefix=PREFIX
option to ./configure in order to get the PAM module to be installed in
the right directory.

## SSH Server Configuration

It is possible to enable PAM authentication in SSH server using
keyboard-interactive challenge-response authentication or
password authentication.

### Keyboard-Interactive Authentication

In order to enable PAM authentication using keyboard-interactive
challenge-response authentication, the following SSH server options must
be set in **/etc/ssh/sshd_config** or such (either explicitly or via
defaults):

* AuthenticationMethods
  - must contain **keyboard-interactive** (or
    **keyboard-interactive:pam**) or must not be set
  - should contain comma-separated lists of authentication method names
    with **keyboard-interactive** (or **keyboard-interactive:pam**) as
    the last list items so that there are successfully completed
    authentication methods and public credentials (e.g. keys) during
    the PAM authentication, for example
    ```
    AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive
    ```
    for mandatory public key authentication and
    mandatory PAM authentication
    using keyboard-interactive challenge-response authentication or
    ```
    AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive keyboard-interactive
    ```
    for optional public key authentication and
    mandatory PAM authentication
    using keyboard-interactive challenge-response authentication
* KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes
  - NOTE: Before OpenSSH version 8.7p1, **ChallengeResponseAuthentication
    yes** was needed for **KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes** to have an
    effect.
* UsePAM yes

### Password Authentication

In order to enable PAM authentication using password authentication,
the following SSH server options must be set in **/etc/ssh/sshd_config**
or such (either explicitly or via defaults):

* AuthenticationMethods
  - must contain **password** (or **password:pam**) or must not be set
  - should contain comma-separated lists of authentication method names
    with **password** (or **password:pam**) as the last list items so
    that there are successfully completed authentication methods and
    public credentials (e.g. keys) during the PAM authentication, for
    example
    ```
    AuthenticationMethods publickey,password
    ```
    for mandatory public key authentication and
    mandatory PAM authentication using password authentication or
    ```
    AuthenticationMethods publickey,password password
    ```
    for optional public key authentication and
    mandatory PAM authentication using password authentication
* PasswordAuthentication yes
* UsePAM yes

## PAM Configuration

In order to enable this module, an appropriate file in
the **/etc/pam.d/** directory (such as **/etc/pam.d/sshd**) must be
modified to contain a line in form of

    auth [auth_err=fail-action, default=error-action, ignore=ignore-action, success=success-action] pam_ssh_auth_info.so [option...] [pattern...]
