Description: SSH authentication information PAM module
 This package provides a Pluggable Authentication Module that is
 designed to succeed or fail authentication based on SSH authentication
 information consisting of a list of successfully completed
 authentication methods and public credentials (e.g. keys) used to
 authenticate the user.
 One use is to select whether to load other modules based on this test.
