.SH "NAME"
pam_ssh_auth_info \- test SSH authentication information

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B  pam_ssh_auth_info.so
.RI [ flag ...]
.RI [ pattern [= pattern ]...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The pam_ssh_auth_info.so PAM module is designed
to succeed or fail authentication
based on SSH authentication information
consisting of a list of
successfully completed authentication methods and
public credentials (e.g. keys)
used to authenticate the user.
One use is to select whether to load other modules based on this test.

Normally,
the module should be given one or more patterns as module arguments, and
authentication will succeed
if SSH authentication information matches all of the patterns
(or any of the patterns depending on the options).
If zero patterns are given as module arguments,
authentication will succeed
if SSH authentication information is available.
If there are no previous successfully completed authentication methods,
SSH authentication information
is not available but missing and
does not match any pattern.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following \fIflag\fRs are supported:
.TP
.B all
All \fIpattern\fRs must match.
This is the default.
.TP
.B any
At least one \fIpattern\fR must match.
.TP
.B debug
Log debugging messages to syslog.
.TP
.IR \fBdisable = service [: service [...]]
Disable pattern matching for the services
listed in the colon separator service list.
.TP
.IR \fBenable = service [: service [...]]
Enable pattern matching only for the services
listed in the colon separator service list.
.TP
.B quiet
Do not log failure or success messages to syslog.
.TP
.B quiet_fail
Do not log failure messages to syslog.
.TP
.B quiet_success
Do not log success messages to syslog.
.TP
.IR \fBrecursion_limit = limit
Change the recursion limit.
This affects extended patterns and \fB*\fR wildcard patterns.

.SS "PATTERNS"
.PP
Any character byte that appears in a pattern,
other than
the extended patterns and
the special pattern characters
described below,
matches itself.
.PP
The special pattern characters have the following meanings:
.TP
.B *
Matches any number of (including zero) word character bytes
but not a word separator (space).
.TP
.B =
Matches equal-sign (\fB=\fR) or a word separator (space).
.IP
This
enables more natural looking patterns and
allows patterns to be written without spaces
avoiding the need for square bracket quoting in PAM configuration files.
.TP
.B ?
Matches any word character byte
but not a word separator (space).
.TP
.B [
A pair of brackets introduces a character byte class.
A character byte class (\fB[\fR...\fB]\fR)
matches any word character byte in the class.
A complemented character byte class (\fB[!\fR...\fB]\fR)
matches any word character byte not in the class.
Neither matches a word separator (space).
A class may contain
character bytes (\fB[abcde]\fR) and
character byte ranges (\fB[a-e]\fR).
.TP
.B \\\\
Preserves the literal meaning of the following character byte.
.PP
The extended patterns have the following meanings:
.TP
.BI "?(" pattern "|" pattern "|" \fR... ")"
Matches zero or one occurence of the given patterns.
Does not match a word separator (space).
.TP
.BI "*(" pattern "|" pattern "|" \fR... ")"
Matches zero or more occurences of the given patterns.
Does not match a word separator (space).
.TP
.BI "+(" pattern "|" pattern "|" \fR... ")"
Matches one or more occurences of the given patterns.
Does not match a word separator (space).
.TP
.BI "@(" pattern "|" pattern "|" \fR... ")"
Matches one of the given patterns.
Does not match a word separator (space).
.TP
.BI "!(" pattern "|" pattern "|" \fR... ")"
Matches anything except one of the given patterns or
a word separator (space).
.PP
SSH authentication information consists of lines having a format like
.IP
.IR method "[/" submethod "] [" key-type " " key-data "] [" info-word "]..."
.PP
SSH authentication information matches a pattern
if on any such line all the words or the initial words
match the pattern.

.SH "MODULE SERVICES PROVIDED"
.PP
All module types
(\fBaccount\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBpassword\fR and \fBsession\fR)
are provided.
That said,
the \fBauth\fR type is still undoubtedly the most useful one.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP
.B PAM_AUTH_ERR
SSH authentication information does not match the patterns.
.TP
.B PAM_IGNORE
The pattern matching is
disabled for the service (see the \fBdisable\fR option) or
not enabled for the service (see the \fBenable\fR option) or
SSH authentication information is missing.
.TP
.B PAM_SUCCESS
SSH authentication information matches the patterns.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Always load an OATH module rule
(to request and check a one-time password)
but load a password module rule
(to request and check the user password)
only
if there are
no previous successfully completed authentications
(in which case SSH authentication information is missing):
.IP
.EX
auth  requisite       oath-module.so option...
auth  [success=1      \\
       ignore=ignore  \\
       default=bad]   pam_ssh_auth_info.so
auth  required        password-module.so try_first_pas option...
.EE
.PP
Load an OATH module rule
(to request and check a one-time password)
only
if there are
no previous successfully completed
FIDO authenticator algorithm based
public key authentications
(in which case SSH authentication information either
is missing or
does not match the pattern)
but always load a password module rule
(to request and check the user password):
.IP
.EX
auth  [success=1        \\
       ignore=ignore    \\
       auth_err=ignore  \\
       default=bad]     pam_ssh_auth_info.so quiet \\
                            publickey=*sk-*@openssh.com
auth  requisite         oath-module.so option...
auth  required          password-module.so try_first_pass option...
.EE
.PP
Require that there is
at least one previous successfully completed
FIDO authenticator algorithm based
public key authentication
(in which case
the key type
contains \(lqsk-\(rq and
ends with \(lq@openssh.com\(rq).
If multiple public key authentications are required,
only one of them is required to be a FIDO authenticator algorithm based one.
.IP
.EX
auth  requisite  pam_ssh_auth_info.so quiet \\
                     publickey=*sk-*@openssh.com
.EE
.PP
Require that there is
at least one previous successfully completed
FIDO authenticator algorithm based
public key authentication
(in which case
the key type
contains \(lqsk-\(rq and
ends with \(lq@openssh.com\(rq) and
at least one previous successfully completed
non-FIDO
public key authentication
(in which case
the key type
does not contain \(lqsk-\(rq or
does not end with \(lq@openssh.com\(rq).
.IP
.EX
auth  requisite  pam_ssh_auth_info.so quiet \\
                     publickey=*sk-*@openssh.com \\
                     publickey=!(*sk-*@openssh.com)

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B SSH_AUTH_INFO_0

consisting of a list of
successfully completed authentication methods and
public credentials (e.g. keys)
used to authenticate the user.
This information is provided
by OpenSSH server since version 7.8p1.
